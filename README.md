shiverdog (aka FatTuesday)'s Hardcore Co-Op Datapack

## Features
When a player dies, they will be forced into Adventure mode and sent into a void dimension.

### New structure: Reincarnation Well
Identified by a steve head on a tall pike, Reincarnation Wells provide opportunities to revive your fallen friends. Though very rare, Reincarnation Wells can be found in many biomes throughout all dimensions.
### Souls
Whenever a player dies with this datapack installed, they will drop a Soul. A Soul has the appearance of the head of the player it belongs to. Souls always glow and emit particles, and are completely indestructible except to the void.
When thrown into a Reincarnation Well, and if the player who the soul belongs to is online, they will materialize in place of the Soul. In doing this, the Well that is used will become exhausted and can never be used again.
